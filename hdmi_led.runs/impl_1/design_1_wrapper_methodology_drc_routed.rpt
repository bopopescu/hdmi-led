2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFG cell design_1_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/GenerateBUFG.ResyncToBUFG_X/InstBUFG I pin is driven by a BUFR cell design_1_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/TMDS_ClockingX/PixelClkBuffer. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFG cascade.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/RefClk is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/RefClk. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/RefClk is defined downstream of clock clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and PixelClk_int are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_int]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and PixelClk_int are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks PixelClk_int]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and PixelClk_int are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */*SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '7' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.

A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
